# Introduction:

This project is to demonstrate my ability to create a _HTML&CSS_  web page application layout from a given mockup, convert it into _React_ and use the React components to create a desired layout.

# Objectives:

In this project I have created a Fashion Blog web page with React, and the process includes:

1. Building the web application locally using only plain HTML and CSS, uploading the completed work to github using git version control and deploying the project on GitHub pages

2. Rebuilding the same web application with React, uploading the project to GitHub and deploying it to Netlify

## Implementation:

#### _HTML & CSS_:

 - Building the web application locally using only plain HTML and CSS
 
 - Uploading the completed work to github using git version control
